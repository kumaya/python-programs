##### identify a graph problem

---
* Problems will somehow use a grid or network in the problem.
* If you are required to find a path of any sort in the problem.
* Common keywords attached to graph problems:
  * vertices
  * nodes
  * edges
  * connections
  * connectivity
  * path
  * cycles
  * direction

##### Representation

***
1. Nodes or Vertices
2. Edges
   * Directed
   * Undirected
   * Can have a cost associated with it.

`Mathemetical representation;` G = {V, E}

**Order:** number of vertices in a graph

**Size:** number of edges in a graph

###### Sidenote:
* **BFS** - For finding the shortest path.
* **DFS** - For finding any solution to the problem (not necessarily
 the shortest path) or visit all nodes in a graph.

###### Representation of graph
* Adjacency matrix:
  * 2D array of size VxV, where V is the number of vertices.
* Adjacency list
